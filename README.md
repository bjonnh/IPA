# IPA
Integrated Probabilistic Annotation (IPA) - A Bayesian annotation method for LC/MS data integrating biochemical relations, isotope patterns and adduct formation

## Getting started
Not sure if I need this section but I am keeping it for now

### Prerequisites
Prior installation, it is necessary to download and install
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) version 3.4.3 or later. R is a programming language and
free software environment. If you are unfamiliar with the R syntax and commands, it is
recommended to read the [introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html)
document first.
<br />
<br />
The download an installation of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is also necessary. RStudio
is a free and open-source integrated development environment for R.
It is also necessary to install the devtools package by simply using the following command in the R session:
```
install.packages(devtools)
```
<br />


## Installation
The installation of the IPA R package is extremely easy and it can be achieved by
simply using the following commands:
```
library(devtools)
install_github("francescodc87/IPA")
```



## Case study - I can use a case study here, maybe the synthetic experiment

Here I have to use a clear example of how to use the software, showing how to use the software.
I should be carefull with what I share here before pubblication
